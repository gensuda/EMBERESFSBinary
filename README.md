# EMBERESFSBinary

In order to run this code, you need to convert .CSV file of your EMBER dataset (simplified binary form, indicators) to .Arff file format supported by
WEKA (https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/downloading_weka/) as this code uses WEKA API to manipulate features and data structures.
